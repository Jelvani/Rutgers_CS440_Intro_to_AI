\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:Experimental Setup}
All tests are performed on the following machine:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OS: Windows 10 Enterprise version 1903
  \item CPU: Intel Core i7-4790 @ 3.60 GHZ
  \item RAM: 16.0 GB
  \item Python Version: 3.8.2 (32-Bit)
\end{itemize}
All run times shown are in seconds, and timing is calculated with Pythons built-in \texttt{time} module. For run-time testing, any print functions that are used in-between timings are disabled, as well as any plotting functions. For each search in a maze, the start and goal coordinates are kept at a constant $(0,0)$ and $(100,100)$ respectively.
